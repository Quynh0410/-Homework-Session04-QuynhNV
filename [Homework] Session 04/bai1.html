    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to format the layout of a webpage.</p>
    <div>
        With CSS, you can control text color, font, size, spacing between elements, and how elements are positioned and
        arranged. You can also set background images or colors, customize different displays for various devices and
        screen sizes, and much more!
    </div>
    <div1 id="a-div1"><b>Tip:</b>
        The term <b>cascading</b> means that a style applied to a parent element will also be applied to all child
        elements within that parent. For instance, if you set the body text color to "blue," all headings, paragraphs,
        and other text elements within the body will inherit the same color (unless specified otherwise).
